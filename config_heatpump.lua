OVERHEAT=1.0						-- Increase temperature setpoint in case of available power from solar photovoltaic
OVERCOOL=-0.2						-- Decrease temperature setpoint in case of available power from solar photovoltaic

--GasHeater='GasHeater'				-- Activate gas heater instead of heat pump when external temperature very low: set to '' if a boiler does not exist
GasHeater=''		-- it's not cheaper not greener than PDC => manually enabled only if PDC is not able to keep the temperature
powerMeter='PowerMeter'	-- device name of power meter, that measure consumed power from the electric grid (negative when photovoltaic produced more than house usage)
inverterMeter='Inverter - Power'	-- Inverter output power (photovoltaic). Set to '' if not available
tempHPout='Temp_HeatPumpFluidOut' 	-- Temperature of water produced by heat pump (before entering coils or underfloor radiant system)
tempHPin= 'Temp_HeatPumpFluidIn'	-- Temperature of water that exits from coils and/or underfloor radiant system, and gets into the Heat Pump again
tempOutdoor='Meteo outdoor'			-- Temperature outdoor, or meteo sensor ("temp;humidity;pression;0")
HPOn='HeatPump'						-- Device that enable/disable the heat pump (thermostat input?)
HPSummer='HeatPump_Summer'			-- Device to set if HP must cooling instead of heating
HPMode='HeatPump_Mode'				-- Selector switch for Off, Winter, Summer

HPNightStart=1260					-- Reduce power and noise in the night, starting from 21:00 (21*60 minutes): set to 1440 to disable
HPNightEnd=450						-- Reduce power and noise in the night, until 7.30 (7*60+30 minutes): set to 0 to disable

zones={ 
	-- start and stop indicates the comport period (hour of the day) when temperature must be equal to the setpoint
	-- offset is the max tolerated difference from set temperature outside the comfort period
	-- weight is used to set the importance of temperature in each rooms. 1=very important, 0.5 means that temperature can be a bit different from the set point, 0=ignore temperature in this room. If weight is less than 1, it's tolerated a greater offset in case there is not enough energy from renewable (photovoltaic)

	-- During the summer, keep setpoin from 7:00 to 23:00, then temperature can raise to setpoint+0.2. Weight is 1 (important zone)
