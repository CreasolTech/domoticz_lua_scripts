## Script script_device_master.lua
This is a main script called every time a device changes state: it's optimized to 
* run quickly
* ignore useless device changes
* call the appropriate scripts associated to the changed devices: for example if the changed device is named PIR* or MCS* or SIREN* , the *alarm.lua* script will be called, while if the device is named power*, the *power.lua* script will be called.


## Script POWER 
File: *power.lua*  and  *config_power.lua*

Destination directory: *DOMOTICZ_DIR/scripts/lua*

Called by *script_device_master.lua* and triggered when a device containing *Power* or *Button* in its name changes state.

Used to check power from energy meter (SDM120, SDM230, ...) and performs the following actions

  1. Send notification when consumed power is above a threshold (to avoid power outage)
  2. Enabe/Disable electric heaters or other appliances, to reduced power consumption from the electric grid
  3. Emergency lights: turn ON some LED devices in case of power outage, and turn off when power is restored
  4. Show on DomBusTH LEDs red and green the produced/consumed power: red LED flashes 1..N times if power consumption is greater than 1..N kW; 
     green LED flashes 1..M times if photovoltaic produces up to 1..M kW 


## Script to computes self-consumption power and percentage, and self-sufficiency percentage
Files: script_time_selfconsumption.lua config_power.lua globalfunctions.lua globalvariables.lua

Destination directory: DOMOTICZ_DIR/scripts/lua

Called every minute

This is a mandatory script for those who have at least one reneable generation plant in their building.

It manages one or more energy production plants (photovoltaic on the roof, photovoltaic in the garden and or wind turbine, ...) **computing the total generated energy/power, total used energy/power, self-consumption energy/power, self-consumption percentage and self-sufficiency percentage**.

These are goods indicators to know if the building is optimized or not.

Detailed info are available at [www.creasol.it/SelfConsumption](https://www.creasol.it/SelfConsumption) page.


## Script that, every time a power meter changes, computes the sum of 2 or more power meters and feeds that value to the DomBusEVSE virtual device
Files: script_device_evsegridpower.lua

This simple script is meant to compute the total power from the grid and feed it to the DomBusEVSE module, EV charging system that must know the total power from the grid, to prevent
overloads and manage solar charging.
In case of 2 or 3 meters are used (for example, a meter for the house, a meter for the electric car, and another meter for the garage, it computes the total power.


## Script to control the EMMETI Mirai heat pump in a smart way
Files: heatpump.lua (script_time_heatpump_emmeti.lua) and config_heatpump_emmeti.lua

Destination directory: DOMOTICZ_DIR/scripts/lua

Called every minute

This script is designed for radiant systems: 
* it measures the temperature in each room, computes a derivative of a temperature to states if the house is warming or not (PID control) and 
regulates the heat pump power to satisfy the warming/cooling needs for the best comfort.
* it's possible to define peak hours where power consumption should be limited, to give your contribution for electricity grid stabilization
* if photovoltaic or wind generator is available, **try to consume most energy from renewable production plants**, improving self consumption
* for each room it's possible to define a period where the set-temperature can be reduced (in Winter, or increased in Summera)
[![alt Optimized management of Heat Pump EMMETI Mirai](https://images.creasol.it/heatpump_emmeti_modbus_solar_power_tracking.png "Heat pump optimized management with this script")](https://www.creasol.it/DomBusTH)


## Script for heat pump and gas heater
Files: script_time_heatpump.lua  and  heatpump_conf.lua

Destination directory: DOMOTICZ_DIR/scripts/lua

Called every minute

This script manages the heat pump, adjusting power and fluid temperature to meet the building demand.

If a photovoltaic system is installed, with a power meter measuring the power exchanged with the electric grid, 
during the summer the heat pump will try to work only when extra power from photovoltaic is produce. No power => heat pump off or at minimum level.

During the winter, the heat pump will work expecially during the day, when external temperature is high, and regulates the fluid temperature smartly
to get the heat pump consuming the most energy from photovoltaic and working hard when external temperature is high, and works at minimum (or off) when
the external temperature does not permit to get an high efficiency


## Script for alarm system
Files: alarm.lua (script_device_alarm.lua) alarm_config.lua  alarm_sendsnapshot.sh  and  alarmSet.sh

Destination directory: DOMOTICZ_DIR/scripts/lua

Called by *script_device_master.lua* and triggered when a device with name starting with *PIR* , *MCS* , *SIREN*, *TAMPER*, *ALARM* or *Light*, changes state, or when the variable *alarmLevelNew* is not zero (alarm started or stopped)

Scripts that manages a **burglar alarm system**: magnetic contact sensors on doors/windows/blinds, PIRs and radars, tampers, sirens.

**Full notifications on Telegram** and 3 working modes fully configurable:

* DAY: it shortly activates internal sirens when a door/window opens or a PIR is activated
* NIGHT: in case of alarm, only activates the internal sirens and turns ON some lights.
* AWAY: in case of alarm, both internal and external sirens are activated. 

Other features:

* External **sirens delay** when alarm is activated on some configurable sensors (for example, main door)
* **Records short videos when external sensors have been activated** (when someone or a cat walk outside)
* Recode short **videos to 2x speed**, and sends to **Telegram channel/group**
* **House presence lights** will be managed when AWAY alarm is active, between Sunset and Sunrise, to simulate that someone is inside the house.

## Fire detector scripts
Files: script_time_fireAlarm.lua  config_fireAlarm.lua

Destination directory: DOMOTICZ_DIR/scripts/lua

LUA script that loads the rooms information from config_fireAlarm.lua and for any room
if Temperature > averageTemperature + deltaT => **fire alarm detected => send notification by Telegram**

More information available at [fire alarm page](https://www.creasol.it/en/support/domotics-home-automation-and-diy/fire-alarm-detection-with-domoticz-home-automation-system)


## Script that check rain and wind
File: script_time_rainCheck.lua

Destination directory: DOMOTICZ_DIR/scripts/lua

Called every minute

Script that checks the raining rate and wind speed, and performs several functions:

* If **raining rate is over 8mm/h, disable external socket in the garden** (connected to the Xmas tree!!).

* Checks wind speed and direction and **disable ventilation when wind speed is zero or wind comes from south or west, where there are few building using wood stoves generating bad smoke smell**.

* Sends weather telemetry to WindGuru

* Send **buzzer alert if a trash bin should be carried out**:
  * 1 beep (followed by 4s pause) for paper
  * 2 beeps (followed by 4s pause) for plastic/metal
  * 3 beeps (followed by 4s pause) for unsorted
  * 4 beeps (followed by 4s pause) for glass
  
  It's programmed to work with the [cheap DomBusTH module](https://www.creasol.it/DomBusTH) which can be placed in a blank cover (in a wallbox) and already provide a piezo buzzer output, red+green+white leds, touch sensor (simulating a pushbutton, that can be used to cancel the alarm), other 4 I/Os, temperature and humidity sensors.
[DomBusTH video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bJ_igU9jgo)

* **Enable/Disable gate power supply to reduce energy consumption and improve antitheft security**: check vehicle position to determine if it's approaching (gate should be enabled) or it's moving away (gate should be disabled).
In any case, the gate power supply is turned OFF when the alarm system is in NIGHT or AWAY mode.

## Script to get data from Fronius inverter

## Script that update a virtual P1 meter from an existing general kWh meter measuring grid power

File *script_device_power2p1.lua* is a LUA script for Domoticz useful for the Energy Dashboard. 
It can be used to update a virtual P1 meter (that you have to create by yourself from Setup -> Hardware menu), writing the current power and energy (usage and return).
Also, the script can handle more generators (photovoltaic on roof, photovoltaic in the garden, wind generator, ...) compute the sum of the power to a virtual device, used by the Energy Dashboard.

Just copy this script in *scripts/lua* folder and update the 6 variables at the top of file.

![alt Example of a Domoticz Energy Dashboard](https://images.creasol.it/domoticz_energy_dashboard.png "Example of a Domoticz Energy Dashboard using the script_device_power2p1.lua script to update the virtual P1 meter")



## Script that fetches electricity energy price from ENTSO-e website (for your specific zone, if you reside in EU) and solar photovoltaic forecast

File *script_time_entsoe.lua* is a LUA script for Domoticz that:
* **fetches** every day, in the afternoon, the **day-ahead electricity prices for your zone**
* update a custom virtual device with the **current energy price (that changes every hour)**
* **compute your real energy cost (including taxes, fees, ...) and update a custom virtual device with that price**
* let Domoticz core to get electricity price from the last custom virtual device, so **Domoticz can show energy costs in the energy dashboard**
* **store in a user variable the energy price of the day, hour by hour, separated by semicolon, and in last position the average price**: in this way it's possible to include in automations the management of load devices (for example climate heat pump) to reduce or increase their power based on the current energy price. For example, **it's possible to set every hour the climate heat pump to work to a targetPower * averagePrice / currentPrice , to save energy when price is high and consume more energy when power is low**. Similar policy can be chosen to **charge the electric vehicle when energy cost is low**.
Although in Italy electric energy cost is based on the montly average price for 3 time slots (day, early morning/evening, night/Sunday), **we should aim to regulate the power consumed by our buildings to increase it when there is more availability and reduce it when there is less availability of electricity.**
* get today and tomorrow solar photovoltaic forecast (estimated energy hour by hour, and total)
* permits to specify one or more photovoltaic strings/systems (with different orientation) to get a precise forecast.
* write a user variable with hour-by-hour estimated energy and total daily energy for today and tomorrow.


### Installation

* Copy files script_time_entsoe.lua globalvariables.lua globalfunctions.lua to the DOMOTICZ/scripts/lua directory
* cd DOMOTICZ; ln -s scripts/lua/XmlParser.lua
* Edit script_time_entsoe.lua : you'll find a description of the procedure to register to ENTSO-e website, get a security token and create two custom devices

![alt Electricity hourly price and cost](https://images.creasol.it/domoticz_entsoe.webp?new "Electricity hourly price, cost, variable with the price hour by hour, and charts")


### Usage
By including the *script/lua/globalvariables.lua* and *script/lua/globalfunctions.lua* , it's possible to use the function 

* *tonumber(getItemFromCSV(uservariables['entsoe_today'], ';', 24))* to get the current average electricity price
* *tonumber(getItemFromCSV(uservariables['entsoe_today'], ';', timeNow.hour))* to get the current electricity price
* *tonumber(getItemFromCSV(uservariables['pv_today'], ';', 24))* to get the total estimated solar energy, today

In the *script_time_heatpump_emmeti.lua* there are some example of how electricity price and solar production are used to limit or increase heat pump power to optimize own-consumption
